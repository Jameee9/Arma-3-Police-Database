# Arma Police Mobile Terminal Database
## Build Version 1.5.0
### Created by Colton Brister - Reworked and Updated by Jamee9

This project was originally started in 2015 by Colton Brister for the game server Life-Studios. Over time, he gradually developed it until 2017, at which point the project was kept private and shared only with a few selected communities. After retiring from gaming, Colton made the project open source, allowing others to use it as long as proper credit was given. I’ve taken on this project as a learning opportunity and am currently working to update it with more modern and up-to-date code. Much of the existing PHP and code structure is outdated, so I’m updating it gradually, one section at a time. This remains an ongoing project.
